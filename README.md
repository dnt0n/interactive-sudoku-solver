# Interactive Sudoku Solver
This is an interactive sudoku solver I made with pygame.
Users can enter the numbers and solve the sudoku puzzle.

Main functionalities include:
1. Number input: Users can move about the boxes with space bar or direction keys, and enter the numbers with number keys.
2. Input modification: Users can modify the number in a box or delete a number in that box with backspace key.
3. Input validation: Users will not be able to input a number in a box if the row, column or 3x3 grid containing that box already has that number. They will get a warning message for invalid inputs.
4. Clear input: Users can clear all inputs with C key.
5. Solve sudoku: Users cans solve the sudoku puzzle with S key. Note that they will not be able to solve if the board is empty. The additional solution numbers will be displayed in green.

This the first personal project that I made entirely by myself with minimal external help :)
